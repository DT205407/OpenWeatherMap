# OpenWeatherMap
=======


This repository contains the source code of the app described as:
Mobile Engineer Exercise
The following is an exercise that you should not spend more than 4 hours on (even if you do not complete the entire exercise).
Please build an app (your preference of iOS or Android) displaying the 5 day weather forecast for a location of your choice, using the data from http://openweathermap.org/forecast5.
You should:
•	Use the API to retrieve the current 5 day weather forecast in JSON and render it on the screen
•	Give some thought to what will make for a decent user experience, but with no need to go all out on sleek and flashy UI

Please upload your solution to GitHub (https://github.com) - you can create a free account if needed. Please make sure the GitHub project is public and respond back to us with the URL for the project.
The solution should be able to be run locally with the appropriate simulator.
Good luck and thank you for your time - we look forward to seeing your creation.


##App
The app is available for download directly from:
Http://www.raiiar.comlu.com/APK/OpenWeatherMap_v2.0.doc  (##AN.B. rename .doc to .apk) -  Give a look.
